# Data Visualization
This repository contains mini-projects and case studies showcasing my advanced knowledge of analytical concepts and appropriate data visualization techniques in the software Tableau.

**This repository is in progress. Additional projects and case studies will be uploaded from external platforms by the end of the first quarter of 2022.**

## RESOURCES
The skills displayed in this repository were strengthened through the reading of the following books:

## SKILLS
### EXPLORATORY DASHBOARDS
* **Sample-Superstore Dataset:** A case study demonstrating the benefits of exploratory dashboards using a fictitious financial and geographical dataset available within Tableauâ€™s internal data sources.

### VISUALIZING RELATIONSHIPS
* **SuperDrugs Dataset:** A mini case study demonstrating the use of relationship analysis techniques to create visualizations that explore sales data for a pharmaceutical company. These techniques include: multivariate and bivariate plots, box-and-whisker plots, bar charts, scatterplots, and bubble charts

### VISUALIZING SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS 
* **US Airline Dataset:** A case study demonstrating the use of spatial relationship analysis techniques to create visualizations that explore flight data for a USA commercial airline. These techniques include: visualizing locations, visualizing a curve path, visualizing regions, visualizing space and time between small multiple charts.

### NETWORK ANALYSIS: USING GEPHI
* **Sawmill Dataset:** A case study demonstrating the use of social network analysis techniques to create a network visualization that explores the communication structure within an organization. These techniques include: network analysis, social network analysis (SNA), acyclic graphs (directed), adjacency lists, node level properties and metrics (degree, global centrality metrics, geodesic distance, closeness centrality, etc.), edge attributes and tie strengths (weighted, clusters, cliques, etc.), and group-level network properties (diameter, network density, centralization, etc.).
