# Sample Superstore Dataset
Exploratory dashboards give users the ability to dive deeper into a subject matter to explore and answer numerous questions about the data. To demonstrate the benefits of exploratory dashboards this report was created as a guide through a particular dataset using screenshots, analytical questions and the rationale for various design techniques for three well-designed data visualizations. 

## Data
The dataset used to demonstrate the benefits of exploratory dashboards in this report is the Sample-Superstore dataset. The Sample-Superstore dataset is a fictitious financial and geographical dataset available within Tableauâ€™s internal data sources. The Sample-Superstore dataset contains three sheets: Orders, People and Returns.

## Purpose
The users of the Sample-Superstore dataset would most likely be people or industries looking to explore questions in regards to financial records, customer behavior, and regional trends. The potential analytical questions within these industries are explored further in the project documentation.
