# US Airline Dataset
A mini case study demonstrating the use of spatial relationship analysis techniques to create visualizations that explore flight data for a USA commercial airline. These techniques include: visualizing locations, visualizing a curve path, visualizing regions, visualizing space and time between small multiple charts.

## Data
The dataset used to demonstrate the use of spatial relationship analysis techniques in this case study is flight data for US airlines from the years 2010 and 2011.
This dataset has almost 8 million records pertaining to detailed flight information, which includes 21 fields such as 'Canceled', 'Diverted', 'Airtime', 'Destination Airport Code', 'Origin Airport Code', 'Origin State', etc. 

## Purpose
To create visualizations in Tableau that provide insight into patterns over time for more than 7 million flights from a dozen or so US airline carriers.
